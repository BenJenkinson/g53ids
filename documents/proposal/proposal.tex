	\section{Background and Motivation}

		At the moment, the visualisation of a multi-agent algorithm is often generated by and tied into the same software that is actually running the algorithm simulation.

		This project aims to separate the visualisation from the simulation, to open up the following possibilities:

		\begin{itemize}

			\item \textbf{Shared Resources} - Several researchers could all follow the progress of a single simulation, each from their own office, as it runs elsewhere. This would be useful for checking in on the progress of a long-running simulation.

			\item \textbf{Ease of Distribution} - A researcher could provide access to another colleague, though they may be geographically distant, to allow them to observe the \textit{same} simulation and troubleshoot some erratic agent behaviour.

			\item \textbf{Demonstrations} - The stakeholder who commissioned the simulation to be run can view an attractive visualisation of its progress. All without the need for any additional software or installation, and without being able to alter the course of the simulation accidentally. This arrangement could be quite useful if the stakeholder is relatively non-technical and unable to run the simulation themselves.

		\end{itemize}

		When the visualisation client is distinct from the application or process that is running the algorithm simulation, my intention is that they would be connected by some form of internet protocol, or data-format read over the internet. The data-format would be used to describe the state of the simulation at any time, describing the agents and their properties, as well as the state of the problem environment.

		This separation would mean that there is no difference between running the simulation and the client on the same computer, and running the simulation remotely. If the client has been written in HTML5 as a single-page web application, then there is no reason why the client cannot be hosted publicly as well and accessed from anywhere in the world.

		This client could then effectively 'tune-in' to a stream of algorithm state-data output by a completely different machine. This would allow multiple researchers or clients to view the algorithm progress in real time while the intensive computation is done elsewhere. Independently, each client could then pause and inspect the data of the visualisation at any time without interfering with any of the other clients.

		All the while, the client could continue downloading the live stream as it is output so that the user can then skip around the timeline of the simulation from whenever they first joined the stream.

	\section{Aims and Objectives}

		\paragraph{The aim of this project shall be to product a framework to both animate and inspect the progress of a multi-agent algorithm.}

		\paragraph{Separation of Concerns} The simulation and the visualisation components will be kept separate, leveraging a protocol/data-format that shall be defined to communicate the state of the simulation. This will function over the internet, allowing the two components to be geographically distant if so required.

		\paragraph{Usability} The visualisation client shall be designed to be intuitive and attractive for the user, who may not be technically-minded.

		\paragraph{Inspector} The visualisation shall incorporate an inspector feature, allowing the playback of the algorithm to be paused and the state of the simulation as a whole, or any individual agent to be examined. This will be designed around debugging the simulation, to understand the reasoning of an agent, or the reason for some unexpected emergent behaviour. (This feature will likely assume some prior knowledge of the algorithm on the part of the user.)

		\paragraph{Multiple Clients} Ideally there will be no limit to the number of clients that could 'tune-in' to a single simulation. Allowing multiple viewers to watch, and inspect, the visualisation independently.

	\section{Project Plan}

		\subsection{Tasks}

			\begin{itemize}

				\item Define a protocol, \textsc{API} or data-format for communicating the state of a multi-agent algorithm simulation.

					\begin{itemize}

						\item Research types of multi-agent algorithm.
						\item Research a variety of problems that can be solved by multi-agent algorithms.
						\item Acquire some example problems and example algorithms to use in development of the visualisation client.
						\item Define the protocol/format ensuring it would successfully describe the example problems and algorithms.
						\item Write explanatory documentation for the protocol/format.

					\end{itemize}

					It would be wise to limit the scope of my project to a sub-group of problems that would suit visualisation. Perhaps those areas for which an in-progress inspection of the algorithm is particularly useful.

				\item Investigate the potential for a server-side component for the production of the algorithm data.

					\begin{itemize}

						\item Research existing software for the simulation of multi-agent algorithms.
						\item Identify whether any of the existing software could be adapted to generate the data-format that has been defined.
						\item If it is possible, adapt an existing simulation to provide the required output.

					\end{itemize}

				\item \textit{(Further)} Develop my own component to generate the required output stream of simulation data.

				\item Design the visualisation client, capable of reading a stream of the defined data-format and buffering it for playback through an ideally attractive and intuitive interface.

					\begin{itemize}

						\item Develop the ability to read in the data-stream from a defined location.
						\item Use \textsc{HTML5} offline storage to buffer the data-stream for playback.
						\item Develop a clear and attractive visualisation for the simulation data.
						\item Develop an 'inspector' for the visualisation, whereby playback can be paused and any particular agent can be inspected.
						\item \textit{(Further)} Draw upon my research of existing visualisation software to determine other useful features for the client to possess, then add them.

					\end{itemize}
